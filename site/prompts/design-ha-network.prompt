🧠 Prompt – Design High Availability (HA) Network Architecture

You are a cloud infrastructure architect. Your task is to design a highly available network setup for a company operating across two physical locations: HQ and Disaster Recovery (DR).

✅ Technical Requirements

Redundant design for:

WAN (dual ISP, BGP if needed)

LAN (stacked switches, LACP)

VPN (failover tunnels or mesh)

Provide:

IPv4/IPv6 schema recommendations

Internal DNS and public DNS separation

Routing failover with metrics (OSPF, VRRP, etc.)

Include security layering:

Segmentation

Firewalls (stateful, NGFW)

Access control (NAC, VLAN, ACL)

Optional: Public cloud integration

AWS Direct Connect / Azure ExpressRoute / GCP Interconnect

📜 Workflow Expectations

State assumptions: bandwidth, SLA, region constraints

Recommend tools or protocols per function

Highlight trade-offs between cost, complexity, and resilience

🧑‍💻 Presentation Style

Text-based diagrams (ASCII/Markdown tables)

Use bulleted lists for components

Explain acronyms on first use

🧾 Output Specification

Architecture summary (text-based diagram)

IP/VLAN plan (optional table)

Risks or blind spots
