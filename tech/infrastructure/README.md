## Real-World Use Cases

These infrastructure design prompts are particularly valuable for:

1. **🔄 Network Resilience**: Designing fault-tolerant network architectures

2. **🚀 Data Center Planning**: Creating optimized data center layouts and interconnections

3. **☁️ Hybrid Cloud Design**: Architecting seamless hybrid environments

4. **🔒 Security Architecture**: Implementing defense-in-depth strategies

5. **📊 Capacity Planning**: Forecasting growth and resource requirements

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Designing a Highly Available Network

When planning a resilient network architecture:

```
[Copy and paste the design-ha-network.prompt content here]

Requirements:
- 99.99% uptime SLA
- Multi-region presence (US East, US West, EU)
- Support for 5,000 concurrent users
- Compliance with GDPR and HIPAA
- Budget constraints: $XXX,XXX initial, $XX,XXX monthly
```

### Example 2: Upgrading Legacy Infrastructure

```
[Copy and paste the design-ha-network.prompt content here]

Current environment:
- Single data center
- Legacy routers and switches (5+ years old)
- No redundant internet connections
- Basic firewall protection
- Frequent outages during peak times

Goal: Transform into a highly available, modern infrastructure
```
