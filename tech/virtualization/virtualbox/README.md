## 📝 Usage Examples

### Example 1: Automating VM Creation and Management

When you need to create and manage VMs programmatically:

```
[Copy and paste the headless-automation.prompt content here]

I need to create a headless VM with:
- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- 2 CPUs, 4GB RAM
- 60GB storage
- Network configured for bridged mode
- Automatic startup and shutdown on host boot/shutdown
```

### Example 2: Setting Up a VM Test Environment

```
[Copy and paste the headless-automation.prompt content here]

I need to set up a testing environment with:
- 3 identical VMs based on Windows Server 2019
- Each with 2GB RAM and 1 CPU
- Connected through an internal network
- Configured to start and stop via script for automated testing
```
