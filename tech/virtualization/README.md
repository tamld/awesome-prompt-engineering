## 🌟 Real-World Use Cases

These virtualization prompts are particularly valuable for:

1. **🚀 Rapid Deployment**: Creating consistently configured virtual machines quickly

2. **🔄 Resource Optimization**: Fine-tuning VM resource allocations and performance

3. **📊 Environment Management**: Managing complex environments with multiple hypervisors

4. **🔍 Troubleshooting**: Diagnosing and resolving virtualization-specific issues

5. **🔒 Security Hardening**: Implementing security best practices across VM fleets

## 📝 Usage Guidelines

These prompts are designed to work with various virtualization technologies. To get the best results:

1. **Be Specific**: Include hypervisor version, VM specifications, and exact requirements
2. **Provide Context**: Describe your environment constraints and operational policies
3. **Include Examples**: Where possible, include examples of existing configurations
4. **Clarify Goals**: Specify whether you're optimizing for performance, density, security, etc.
