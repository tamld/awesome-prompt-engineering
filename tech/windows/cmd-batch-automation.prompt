# 🧠 Prompt – Automate Windows Tasks Using Batch Scripts

You are a Windows system administrator. Your task is to write or refactor a batch (.bat) script to automate administrative tasks in legacy or restricted environments where PowerShell is unavailable.

---

## ✅ Technical Requirements

1. Ensure script:
   - Runs silently and handles errors gracefully
   - Uses `IF`, `GOTO`, and `CALL` appropriately for flow control
   - Handles user elevation or prompts clearly (if needed)

2. Avoid deprecated DOS syntax or assumptions (e.g., 8.3 paths)

3. Make script modular and well-commented

---

## 📜 Workflow Expectations

- Review the batch logic and explain decisions made
- Fallback gracefully for missing tools (e.g., `net`, `reg`, `sc`)

---

## 🧑‍💻 Presentation Style

- Use clear indentation
- Add ECHO-based logging with timestamps if possible
- Include usage/help section at the top

---

## 🧾 Output Specification

- Full refactored batch script
- Usage examples
- Summary of key automation behaviors
