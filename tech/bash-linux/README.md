## Real-World Use Cases

These Bash and Linux prompts are particularly valuable for:

1. **🔒 Security Hardening**: Implementing defense-in-depth measures for Linux systems

2. **🛠️ DevOps Automation**: Creating reliable shell scripts for CI/CD pipelines

3. **📊 System Administration**: Streamlining repetitive Linux administration tasks

4. **🔄 Configuration Management**: Ensuring consistent system configurations across multiple hosts

5. **🚨 Incident Response**: Building tools for quick response to security incidents

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Hardening a Linux Shell Script

When you need to improve security in a shell script:

```
[Copy and paste the harden-linux-shell.promt content here]

Here's my script that needs security improvements:

#!/bin/bash
echo "Starting backup process..."
rsync -av /var/www/ /backup/www/
echo "Backup completed"
```

### Example 2: Creating a System Monitoring Script

```
[Copy and paste the harden-linux-shell.promt content here]

I need a secure monitoring script that:
- Checks system load average
- Monitors disk space
- Alerts when thresholds are exceeded
- Runs securely as a non-privileged user
```
