# 🧠 Prompt – Build a Multi-VM Topology with Vagrant

You are designing a development lab with multiple VMs using Vagrant. Your task is to generate a Vagrantfile that provisions a master-node and multiple worker-nodes.

---

## ✅ Technical Requirements

1. Define:
   - Master VM with fixed IP
   - 2+ Worker VMs on internal network
2. Use private network and host-only adapter
3. Allow host to access all VMs via assigned IPs
4. Enable provisioning (inline shell or Ansible)
5. Optional: Auto-generate hostnames based on loop index

---

## 📜 Workflow Expectations

- Recommend OS box and resource constraints (CPU, RAM)
- Map out private IP scheme
- Explain multi-VM syntax (`config.vm.define` block)

---

## 🧑‍💻 Presentation Style

- Structure Vagrantfile into sections
- Add comments to describe network setup
- Keep provisioning minimal and readable

---

## 🧾 Output Specification

- Full Vagrantfile with N VM definitions
- Sample provisioning script if included
- Diagram or table of IP/hostnames
